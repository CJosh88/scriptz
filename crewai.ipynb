      "[INFO]: Starting Task: Develop a comprehensive project roadmap and sprint plans using a selected lean and agile methodology,   aimed at delivering a digital chatbot product. The chatbot should allow the client to upload job specifications and   a maximum of 100 resumes, then score each CV and present the results on an interactive dashboard for candidate comparison.   Key deliverables include a detailed project roadmap outlining major milestones, sprint plans with specific goals,   user stories, and acceptance criteria for each feature. Collaborate closely with the development team and stakeholders   to refine requirements and ensure alignment with client expectations. Iteratively review and adapt the plan based on   feedback and project progress. Document all planning and execution strategies in a clear and accessible format,   ensuring transparency and stakeholder engagement throughout the project lifecycle. Confirm the draft with the client   and team for validation before finalizing the comprehensive project plan for the next 4 months.\n",
