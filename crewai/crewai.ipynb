Key deliverables include a detailed project roadmap outlining major milestones, sprint plans with specific goals,   user stories, and acceptance criteria for each feature. Collaborate closely with the development team and stakeholders   to refine requirements and ensure alignment with client expectations. Iteratively review and adapt the plan based on   feedback and project progress. Document all planning and execution strategies in a clear and accessible format,   ensuring transparency and stakeholder engagement throughout the project lifecycle. Confirm the draft with the client   and team for validation before finalizing the comprehensive project plan for the next 4 months.\n",

      "1. **Code Review**: Regularly review the code written by the junior developer. This could be done through a shared repository where you can check the committed code. Look for coding best practices, efficient implementation, readability, and adherence to the project requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feedback Sessions**: Schedule weekly meetings to provide constructive feedback. Discuss the code, point out areas of improvement, and recognize the good points. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Report**: After each sprint, create a detailed report summarizing the code review findings. Include the recommended changes, and guidance provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Project Progress Assessment**: In the report, also assess the project's progress towards the build and release phases. Highlight any potential risks or delays and discuss with the team to find solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Knowledge Sharing Sessions**: Facilitate regular knowledge sharing sessions. These could be about best practices, new technologies or libraries, or a difficult piece of code in the project. The aim should be to foster a learning environment and upskill the junior developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the final deliverable, you would have the application code reviewed and improved after each sprint. The code should be annotated with comments explaining the logic, especially for complex parts. Accompany the code with a comprehensive writeup detailing the review process, changes made, and recommendations for future development practices. \n",

      "1. Code Reviews:\n",
      "- Before starting the review, ensure the code is in a version control system like Git.\n",
      "- Use pull requests for code reviews. This helps in tracking the comments and changes suggested.\n",
      "- Make sure to review the code in small chunks. It's easier and more effective to review 200-400 lines of code at a time.\n",
      "- Look for any obvious errors in the code.\n",
      "- Check for code clarity. Ensure that the code is easy to understand and well-commented.\n",
      "- Check for adherence to coding standards and guidelines.\n",
      "- Check for code performance issues.\n",
      "- Check for any security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Feedback Sessions:\n",
      "- Hold regular feedback sessions after each sprint. This could be a part of your retrospective.\n",
      "- Keep the feedback constructive and specific. Provide clear examples of what was done well and what needs improvement.\n",
